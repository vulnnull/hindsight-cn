# Hindsight

**Long-term memory for AI agents.**

AI assistants forget everything between sessions. Hindsight fixes that with a memory system that handles temporal reasoning, entity connections, and personality-aware responses.

## Why Hindsight?

- **Temporal queries** — "What did Alice do last spring?" requires more than vector search
- **Entity connections** — Knowing "Alice works at Google" + "Google is in Mountain View" = "Alice works in Mountain View"
- **Agent opinions** — Agents form and recall beliefs with confidence scores
- **Personality** — Big Five traits influence how agents process and respond to information

## 60-seconds step


### 1. Install the Hindsight All package (client + API)

```bash
pip install hindsight-all
```

### 2. Import your OpenAI API key
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=xx
```

### 3. Run embedded server and client

```python
import os
from hindsight import HindsightServer, HindsightClient

with HindsightServer(llm_provider="openai", llm_model="gpt-5.1-mini", llm_api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]) as server:
    client = HindsightClient(base_url=server.url)

    # Retain memories
    client.retain(bank_id="my-agent", content="Alice works at Google")
    client.retain(bank_id="my-agent", content="Bob prefers Python over JavaScript")

    # Recall memories
    client.recall(bank_id="my-agent", query="What does Alice do?")

    # Get memory perspective
    client.reflect(bank_id="my-agent", query="Tell me about Alice")
```
