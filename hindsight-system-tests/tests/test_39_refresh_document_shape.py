"""A refresh whose document comes back in the wrong shape is re-asked, not stored.

The refresh is the one path that stores a *document*: the agent states its
structure and the markdown is rendered from it, so the model never writes the
text that gets persisted (#3361). That only holds while the structure is
actually a structure. When a model emitted a block as `{"text": "..."}` where
the schema asks for a plain string, the tolerant coercion ran it through
`str()` — the Python repr — and the literal `{'text': '...'}` became the
block's markdown. It reached `mental_models.content`, and from there every
prompt built from that content, until the next full refresh happened to comply
(#4910).

This is the seam no single-mechanism test crosses: the shape arrives in reflect
and the damage shows up in what a later read returns. So the story is told from
the outside — script the refresh's `done` call with the wrong shape, then read
the model back and look at what a consumer would get.
