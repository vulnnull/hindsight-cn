"""The knowledge-base tree and search can be narrowed to the pages a caller may see.

Pages carry tags (``user:kate``) the same way memories do, and the reads that list
them take recall's tag filter: ``tags`` + ``tags_match``, or compound ``tag_groups``.
Before this, both reads returned every page in the bank — a page tagged for one user
showed up, with its snippet, in another user's search — and an extension that can only
allow or block a call whole had no way to trim the list.

What is pinned here is the seam between page tags and the two listing reads: a filter
must remove the page *and* any folder left with nothing in it (a folder's name says as
much as its pages), and search must rank only within the matching pages.

The pages are created in an empty bank, so they hold no synthesized body and no LLM
call is made: the filter is about tags and placement, not content.
