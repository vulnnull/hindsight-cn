"""Two people share a bank; a validator confines each to their own tag plus the team's rules.

Kate writes a note under `user:kate` with the `rules` retain strategy. One sentence in it is a
team rule, and the strategy's entity label `kind` (with `tag: true`) projects it into the shared
`kind:rule` scope — the only part of her note meant for anyone else. Dan writes under
`user:dan`. The server's operation validator (`server_extensions/tag_scope_validator.py`)
lets each API key read `user:<key>` OR `kind:rule`, and write only `user:<key>`; Kate, who
sets the rules, may also write `kind:rule` (#5032).

This is where the pieces meet: label extraction tags a single fact, the forced scope admits
that fact to Dan, and the note it came from must still stay Kate's — its chunk and its
document are hers, even though one fact extracted from them is not (#5030). Entities count
only what Dan can see (#5031). And Dan, who can read the rule, still cannot change it: not
by retaining with the `rules` strategy, not by tagging a memory `kind:rule`, not by editing
the rule itself.
