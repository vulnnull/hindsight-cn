"""A fact shared through a tag does not share the note it came from (#5030).

Two people share a bank. Kate writes a note tagged `user:kate`; an entity label
with `tag: true` marks its team rules, so those facts also carry `kind:rule`. Dan
reads with `user:dan` + `kind:rule`, strict. He should see his own facts and the
rules — and nothing else of Kate's.

The facts were always scoped right. The seam is the step *after* the fact: recall
with chunks and reflect's `expand` hand back the fact's source text, and that text
is Kate's whole note, private paragraph included. Each path is a composition no
single-mechanism test spans: label tagging at retain, a tag filter at read, and a
source lookup that never looked at the document's own tags.

Every leak assertion is paired with Kate reading the same thing, so a passing test
means the filter held — not that the text was never there to leak.
