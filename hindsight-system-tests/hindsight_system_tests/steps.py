"""Which pipeline step an LLM call belongs to, decided in exactly one place.

Nothing on the wire says "this is fact extraction". The scope is a server-side
concept, the ``json_schema`` name is the constant ``"response"``, and the model
name is whatever the deployment configured. All that reaches the stub is the
prompt.

So a step is identified by an anchor: a short, load-bearing phrase from its
prompt. Tests never write those phrases — they say ``on_step("extract_facts")``
and the mapping lives here. That is the difference between a prompt edit costing
one line and costing thirty red tests, which is the failure mode that kills
wiremock-style suites.

When an anchor stops matching, the miss report prints the prompt that arrived;
fix the anchor here, once.
