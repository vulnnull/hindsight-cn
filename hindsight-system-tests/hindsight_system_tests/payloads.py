"""The payloads the stub returns, as models rather than hand-built dicts.

Two reasons these are typed. The extraction envelope has six required fields, most
of which are "N/A" in any given test, so writing them inline would bury the one or
two a test actually cares about. And a mistyped key in a raw dict does not fail
here — it fails several layers away as "all N facts returned by the LLM were
unusable", which is a long walk back to a typo.
