    prompt = f"""You are extracting facts from text for an AI memory system. Each fact will be stored and retrieved later.

## CONTEXT INFORMATION
- Current reference date/time: {event_date_str}
- Context: {context if context else 'no context provided'}

## CRITICAL: Facts must be DETAILED, COMPREHENSIVE, and CONTEXT-RICH

Each fact should:
1. Be SELF-CONTAINED - readable without the original context
2. Include ALL relevant details: WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, WHY, HOW
3. **CRITICAL: ALWAYS include the SUBJECT (who is doing/saying/experiencing)**
4. **Preserve ALL context**: photos/images, "new" things, visual elements, medium of communication
5. Preserve specific names, dates, numbers, locations, relationships, modifiers (new, old, first, etc.)
6. Resolve pronouns to actual names/entities (I → speaker name, their → possessor name)
7. **CRITICAL: Preserve possessive relationships** (their kids → whose kids, his car → whose car)
8. Capture nuances, reasons, causes, implications, and surrounding context

**COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:**
- ❌ "The kids were excited" → Missing WHO the kids belong to
- ✅ "Melanie's kids were excited" or "Melanie took her kids who were excited"
- ❌ "Nate chose his hair color because it's bright and bold" → Missing that it's NEW and in a PHOTO
- ✅ "Nate shared a photo of his new hair color, which he chose because it's bright and bold"
- ❌ "Alice started a job at Google" → Missing that it's NEW
- ✅ "Alice started a new job at Google"

## TEMPORAL INFORMATION (VERY IMPORTANT)
For each fact, extract the ABSOLUTE date/time when it occurred:
- If text mentions ABSOLUTE dates ("on March 15, 2024", "last Tuesday"), use that date
- If text mentions RELATIVE times ("yesterday", "last week", "last month", "last year", "this morning", "3 days ago", "next year"), calculate the absolute date using the reference date above
- **CRITICAL**: Transform relative temporal expressions in the FACT TEXT to absolute context:
  - "last year" → "in [calculated year]" (e.g., if reference is 2023, "last year" becomes "in 2022")
  - "last month" → "in [month name] [year]" (e.g., if reference is March 2024, "last month" becomes "in February 2024")
  - "last week" → "week of [date]" or keep as "last week" with absolute date field
  - "yesterday" → can stay as "yesterday" with absolute date field
- If NO specific time is mentioned, use the reference date
- Always output dates in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ

Examples of date extraction and fact text transformation:
- Reference: 2024-03-20T10:00:00Z
- "Yesterday I went hiking" → fact: "Yesterday I went hiking", date: 2024-03-19T10:00:00Z
- "Last week I joined Google" → fact: "Last week I joined Google", date: 2024-03-13T10:00:00Z (approximately)
- "Last year we visited Paris" → fact: "In 2023 we visited Paris", date: 2023-03-20T10:00:00Z
- "Last month I started a new job" → fact: "In February 2024 I started a new job", date: 2024-02-20T10:00:00Z
- "This morning I had coffee" → fact: "This morning I had coffee", date: 2024-03-20T08:00:00Z
- "I work at Google" (no time mentioned) → date: 2024-03-20T10:00:00Z (use reference)

## What to EXTRACT (BE EXHAUSTIVE - DO NOT SKIP ANYTHING):
- **Biographical information (CRITICAL - NEVER MISS)**:
  - Origins: home country, birthplace, where someone is from ("my home country Sweden" = Caroline is from Sweden)
  - Current location: where they live now
  - Jobs, roles, backgrounds, experiences, skills
  - Family background, heritage, cultural identity
  - Education, training, certifications
- **Events (NEVER MISS THESE)**:
  - ANY action that happened (went, did, attended, joined, started, finished, etc.)
  - Photos, images, videos shared or taken ("here's a photo", "took a picture", "captured")
  - Social activities (meetups, gatherings, meals, conversations)
  - Achievements, milestones, accomplishments
  - Travels, visits, locations visited
  - Purchases, acquisitions, creations
- **Identity and personal details**:
  - Origins, nationality, home country, roots
  - Cultural background, heritage
  - Family connections (grandmother from X, parents in Y)
- **Opinions and beliefs**: who believes what and why
- **Recommendations and advice**: specific suggestions with reasoning
- **Descriptions**: detailed explanations of how things work
- **Social relationships and nicknames (CRITICAL - ALWAYS EXTRACT)**:
  - Nicknames: how different people refer to someone ("Andrey calls Joanne 'Jo'", "Everyone calls him Bobby")
  - Terms of address: how people address each other (formal names, nicknames, titles)
  - Relationship indicators: how people describe their relationships ("considers X as a mentor", "refers to Y as their best friend")
  - Social dynamics: who knows whom, who interacts with whom
  - Even if not an "event", these are FACTS about social relationships
  - Extract BOTH the person using the name AND the person being referred to
- **Relationships**: connections between people, organizations, concepts
- **States and conditions**: current status, ongoing situations

## CRITICAL: Extract EVERY event with FULL CONTEXT
- "here's a photo of my new car" = shared a photo of their NEW car (preserve "new")
- "I was with friends last week" = meetup/gathering with friends last week
- "sent you that link" = action of sending a link
- "got a new job" = preserve "new" - it's important context
- DO NOT skip events just because they seem minor or casual
- DO NOT drop modifiers like "new", "first", "old", "favorite" - they're critical context

## What to SKIP (ONLY these):
- Greetings, thank yous, acknowledgments (unless they reveal information)
- Filler words ("um", "uh", "like")
- Pure reactions without content ("wow", "cool", "nice")
- Incomplete thoughts or sentence fragments with no meaning

## FACT TYPE CLASSIFICATION (CRITICAL):
For EACH fact, classify it as either 'world' or 'agent':

- **'world'**: General facts about the world, events, people, things that happen
  - Examples: "Alice works at Google", "Bob went hiking in Yosemite", "The meeting is scheduled for Monday"
  - Most facts will be 'world' type

- **'agent'**: Facts specifically about what the AI agent did or actions the agent took
  - Examples: "The AI agent helped the user debug their code", "The agent answered a question about Python", "The agent created a new file"
  - ONLY use 'agent' if the fact is explicitly about the AI agent's actions
  - Conversations with the user where the agent participated are 'agent' type
  - Tasks performed BY the agent are 'agent' type

When in doubt, classify as 'world'.

## ENTITY EXTRACTION (CRITICAL):
For EACH fact, extract ALL important entities mentioned with their types:
- **PERSON**: Names of individuals (Alice, Bob, Dr. Smith)
- **ORG**: Companies, institutions, teams (Google, MIT, AI Team)
- **PLACE**: Cities, countries, locations, venues (Mountain View, Yosemite, The Coffee Shop)
- **PRODUCT**: Specific products, tools, technologies (iPhone, Python, TensorFlow)
- **CONCEPT**: Important topics, projects, subjects (AI, machine learning, Project Phoenix)
- **OTHER**: Entities that don't fit the above categories (events, time periods, etc.)

Entity extraction rules:
- Use the EXACT form as it appears in the fact (preserve capitalization)
- Assign the correct type to distinguish ambiguous entities (Apple the company = ORG, apple the fruit = PRODUCT/CONCEPT)
- Use OTHER only for entities that truly don't fit the other categories
- Include both full names and commonly used short forms if both appear
- Extract proper nouns and key identifying terms
- Skip generic terms (the, a, some) and pronouns (he, she, they)
- Each entity must have both text and type

## EXAMPLES of GOOD facts (detailed, comprehensive):

Input: "Alice mentioned she works at Google in Mountain View. She joined the AI team last year."
GOOD fact: "Alice works at Google in Mountain View on the AI team, which she joined in 2023"

GOOD entities: [
  {{"text": "conference", "type": "OTHER"}},
  {{"text": "Monday", "type": "OTHER"}},
  {{"text": "convention center", "type": "PLACE"}}
]
NOTE: Use OTHER for entities like events (conference) or time references (Monday) that don't fit other categories

Input: "Melanie said 'Yesterday I took the kids to the museum - it was so cool seeing their eyes light up!'"
BAD fact: "The kids were excited about the museum"
BAD entities: [{{"text": "museum", "type": "PLACE"}}]

   entities: [{{"text": "Sarah", "type": "PERSON"}}, {{"text": "Dr. Chen", "type": "PERSON"}}, {{"text": "Michael", "type": "PERSON"}}]
2. "Sarah told someone to call Dr. Chen by his first name Michael"
   entities: [{{"text": "Sarah", "type": "PERSON"}}, {{"text": "Dr. Chen", "type": "PERSON"}}, {{"text": "Michael", "type": "PERSON"}}]
NOTE: Extract both the event (introduction) AND the social relationship fact (how to address him)

Input: "Alex considers Maria his mentor and always refers to her as 'the expert'."
GOOD facts (extract MULTIPLE facts):
1. "Alex considers Maria his mentor"
   entities: [{{"text": "Alex", "type": "PERSON"}}, {{"text": "Maria", "type": "PERSON"}}]
2. "Alex refers to Maria as 'the expert'"
   entities: [{{"text": "Alex", "type": "PERSON"}}, {{"text": "Maria", "type": "PERSON"}}]

   entities: []
NOTE: Extract both the biographical fact AND the nickname/term of address

## TEXT TO EXTRACT FROM:
{chunk}

Remember:
1. BE EXHAUSTIVE - Extract EVERY event, action, and fact with FULL CONTEXT
2. **PRESERVE ALL CONTEXT** - photos, visual elements, "new" things, modifiers (new/old/first/favorite)
3. **ALWAYS include the SUBJECT** - never say "the kids" without saying whose kids
4. **Preserve possessive relationships** - "their kids" must become "Person's kids"
5. **Extract biographical details as SEPARATE facts** - "my home country Sweden" → "Person is from Sweden"
6. **Extract SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS and NICKNAMES** - even if not events, these are facts
7. DO NOT drop modifiers or context - "new hair" stays "new hair", "photo of X" stays "photo of X"
8. Extract absolute dates by calculating relative times from the reference date
9. **CLASSIFY EACH FACT**: 'world' for general facts, 'agent' for AI agent actions
10. Extract ALL entities with types (PERSON, ORG, PLACE, PRODUCT, CONCEPT, OTHER)
11. When in doubt, EXTRACT IT with MORE CONTEXT rather than less"""

    Extract semantic facts from conversational or narrative text using LLM.

    For large texts (>chunk_size chars), automatically chunks at sentence boundaries
    to avoid hitting output token limits. Processes ALL chunks in PARALLEL for speed.

    If a chunk produces output that exceeds token limits (OutputTooLongError), it is
    automatically split in half and retried recursively until successful.

    Args:
        text: Input text (conversation, article, etc.)
        event_date: Reference date for resolving relative times
        context: Context about the conversation/document
        llm_config: LLM configuration to use (if None, uses default from environment)
        chunk_size: Maximum characters per chunk
