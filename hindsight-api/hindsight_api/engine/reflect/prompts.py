Your task is to identify potential observations (beliefs, preferences, patterns, behaviors) that could be part of a mental model about this person/topic.

## Important: Avoid Redundancy
If existing observations are provided, DO NOT generate candidates that are essentially the same.
Focus on discovering NEW patterns not already covered by existing observations.

## Rules
- Generate 5-15 candidate observations for NEW patterns only
- Each candidate should be specific and testable (can be supported or contradicted by evidence)
- Note which memory IDs inspired each candidate (these are seeds, not final evidence)
- Focus on patterns that appear MULTIPLE TIMES across many memories - the more the better
- The best candidates are ones you can find 10, 20, or even 50+ supporting memories for
- Skip patterns that are already covered by existing observations

## Output Format
Return a JSON array of candidate observations:

  "candidates": [

    }
  ]

## Your Task
1. Evaluate each candidate based on the evidence
2. For valid candidates, extract EXACT QUOTES from supporting memories
3. Discard candidates with insufficient or contradicting evidence
4. Merge similar candidates into single, refined observations

## Rules for Quotes
- Quotes must be EXACT text from the memory, not paraphrased
- Each quote should directly support the observation
- The MORE evidence quotes, the BETTER - don't limit yourself, include ALL relevant quotes (10, 20, 50+)
- Observations with only 1-2 quotes are weak and should be discarded unless the evidence is exceptionally strong
- Stronger observations have more supporting evidence - aim for comprehensive coverage

## Output Format
Return validated observations with evidence:

## Title Guidelines
- Title should be a SHORT label (like "Prefers morning meetings" or "Coffee enthusiast")
- NOT a truncated version of the content
- Think of it as a category/tag for the observation

Be rigorous: only keep observations with clear, verifiable evidence from multiple memories."""

- Each observation must have evidence with exact quotes
- COMBINE evidence from both existing and new observations
- If an existing observation has new supporting evidence, ADD ALL the new evidence to it
- Include ALL relevant evidence - the more quotes the better (10, 20, 50+ is great)
- Observations with more evidence are more reliable - don't limit the number of quotes

UPDATE_EXISTING_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are updating existing observations with newly found evidence.

For each existing observation, you have been given:
- The original observation (title, content, existing evidence)
- Newly found supporting memories
- Newly found contradicting memories

## Your Task
1. Extract EXACT QUOTES from new supporting memories to add to the observation
2. Flag observations with strong contradicting evidence for potential removal
3. Keep existing evidence intact - only ADD new evidence

## Rules for Quotes
- Quotes must be EXACT text from the memory, not paraphrased
- Each quote should directly support the observation
- Include ALL relevant quotes from the new memories

## Output Format
Return updated observations with new evidence:
```json
{
  "updated_observations": [
    {
      "title": "Original title",
      "content": "Original content",
