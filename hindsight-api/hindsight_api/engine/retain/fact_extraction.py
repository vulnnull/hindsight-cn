══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SELECTIVITY - CRITICAL (Reduces 90% of unnecessary output)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ONLY extract facts that are:
✅ Personal info: names, relationships, roles, background
✅ Preferences: likes, dislikes, habits, interests (e.g., "Alice likes coffee")
✅ Significant events: milestones, decisions, achievements, changes
✅ Plans/goals: future intentions, deadlines, commitments
✅ Expertise: skills, knowledge, certifications, experience
✅ Important context: projects, problems, constraints
✅ Sensory/emotional details: feelings, sensations, perceptions that provide context
✅ Observations: descriptions of people, places, things with specific details

DO NOT extract:
❌ Generic greetings: "how are you", "hello", pleasantries without substance
❌ Pure filler: "thanks", "sounds good", "ok", "got it", "sure"
❌ Process chatter: "let me check", "one moment", "I'll look into it"
❌ Repeated info: if already stated, don't extract again

CONSOLIDATE related statements into ONE fact when possible.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FACT FORMAT - BE CONCISE
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. **what**: Core fact - concise but complete (1-2 sentences max)
2. **when**: Temporal info if mentioned. "N/A" if none. Use day name when known.
3. **where**: Location if relevant. "N/A" if none.
4. **who**: People involved with relationships. "N/A" if just general info.
5. **why**: Context/significance ONLY if important. "N/A" if obvious.

CONCISENESS: Capture the essence, not every word. One good sentence beats three mediocre ones.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
COREFERENCE RESOLUTION
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Link generic references to names when both appear:
- "my roommate" + "Emily" → use "Emily (user's roommate)"
- "the manager" + "Sarah" → use "Sarah (the manager)"

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CLASSIFICATION
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

fact_kind:
- "event": Specific datable occurrence (set occurred_start/end)
- "conversation": Ongoing state, preference, trait (no dates)

fact_type:
- "world": About user's life, other people, external events
- "assistant": Interactions with assistant (requests, recommendations)

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TEMPORAL HANDLING
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Use "Event Date" from input as reference for relative dates.
- "yesterday" relative to Event Date, not today
- For events: set occurred_start AND occurred_end (same for point events)
- For conversation facts: NO occurred dates

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ENTITIES
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Include: people names, organizations, places, key objects, abstract concepts (career, friendship, etc.)
Always include "user" when fact is about the user.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EXAMPLES
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Example 1 - Selective extraction (Event Date: June 10, 2024):
Input: "Hey! How's it going? Good morning! So I'm planning my wedding - want a small outdoor ceremony. Just got back from Emily's wedding, she married Sarah at a rooftop garden. It was nice weather. I grabbed a coffee on the way."

Output: ONLY 2 facts (skip greetings, weather, coffee):
1. what="User planning wedding, wants small outdoor ceremony", who="user", why="N/A", entities=["user", "wedding"]
2. what="Emily married Sarah at rooftop garden", who="Emily (user's friend), Sarah", occurred_start="2024-06-09", entities=["Emily", "Sarah", "wedding"]

Example 2 - Professional context:
Input: "Alice has 5 years of Kubernetes experience and holds CKA certification. She's been leading the infrastructure team since March. By the way, she prefers dark roast coffee."

Output: ONLY 2 facts (skip coffee preference - too trivial):
1. what="Alice has 5 years Kubernetes experience, CKA certified", who="Alice", entities=["Alice", "Kubernetes", "CKA"]
2. what="Alice leads infrastructure team since March", who="Alice", entities=["Alice", "infrastructure"]
