"""
Link Expansion graph retrieval.

Expands from semantic/temporal seeds through three parallel, first-class signals
stored in memory_links:

1. Entity links  — precomputed co-occurrence graph (created at retain time, bounded to
                   MAX_LINKS_PER_ENTITY per entity). Score = number of distinct shared
                   entities between the seed set and each candidate.
2. Semantic links — precomputed kNN graph (each new fact linked to its top-5 most
                    similar existing facts at insert time, similarity >= 0.7). Checked
                    in both directions since the graph is not symmetric. Score = weight.
3. Causal links  — explicit causal chains (causes/caused_by/enables/prevents).
                   Score = weight + 1.0 (boosted as highest-quality signal).

All three signals are bounded at retain time, so no LATERAL fan-out caps are needed
at query time. Each expansion is a simple aggregation over a small result set.

For non-observation fact types the three expansions are issued as a single CTE query
(one roundtrip, one connection) with a `source` discriminator column so the Python
merge step can apply per-signal score transformations.
