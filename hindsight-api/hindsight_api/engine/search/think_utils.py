    extraction_prompt = f"""Extract any NEW opinions or perspectives from the answer below and rewrite them in FIRST-PERSON as if YOU are stating the opinion directly.

ORIGINAL QUESTION:
{query}

ANSWER PROVIDED:
{text}

Your task: Find opinions in the answer and rewrite them AS IF YOU ARE THE ONE SAYING THEM.

An opinion is a judgment, viewpoint, or conclusion that goes beyond just stating facts.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT extract statements like:
- "I don't have enough information"
- "The facts don't contain information about X"
- "I cannot answer because..."

ONLY extract actual opinions about substantive topics.

CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
1. **ALWAYS start with first-person phrases**: "I think...", "I believe...", "In my view...", "I've come to believe...", "Previously I thought... but now..."
2. **NEVER use third-person**: Do NOT say "The speaker thinks..." or "They believe..." - always use "I"
3. Include the reasoning naturally within the statement
4. Provide a confidence score (0.0 to 1.0)

CORRECT Examples (✓ FIRST-PERSON):
- "I think Alice is more reliable because she consistently delivers on time and writes clean code"
- "Previously I thought all engineers were equal, but now I feel that experience and track record really matter"
- "I believe reliability is best measured by consistent output over time"
- "I've come to believe that track records are more important than potential"

WRONG Examples (✗ THIRD-PERSON - DO NOT USE):
- "The speaker thinks Alice is more reliable"
- "They believe reliability matters"
- "It is believed that Alice is better"

If no genuine opinions are expressed (e.g., the response just says "I don't know"), return an empty list."""
