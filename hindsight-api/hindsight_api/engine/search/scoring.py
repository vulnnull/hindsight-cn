    Calculate recency weight using logarithmic decay.

    This provides much better differentiation over long time periods compared to
    exponential decay. Uses a log-based decay where the half-life parameter controls
    when memories reach 50% weight.

    Examples:
        - Today (0 days): 1.0
        - 1 year (365 days): ~0.5 (with default half_life=365)
        - 2 years (730 days): ~0.33
        - 5 years (1825 days): ~0.17
        - 10 years (3650 days): ~0.09

    This ensures that 2-year-old and 5-year-old memories have meaningfully
    different weights, unlike exponential decay which makes them both ~0.
