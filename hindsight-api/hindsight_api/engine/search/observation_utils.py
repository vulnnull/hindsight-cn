FACTS ABOUT {entity_name.upper()}:
{facts_text}

Your task: Synthesize the facts into clear, objective observations about {entity_name}.

GUIDELINES:
1. Each observation should be a factual statement about {entity_name}
2. Combine related facts into single observations where appropriate
3. Be objective - do not add opinions, judgments, or interpretations
4. Focus on what we KNOW about {entity_name}, not what we assume
5. Include observations about: identity, characteristics, roles, relationships, activities
6. Write in third person (e.g., "John is..." not "I think John is...")
7. If there are conflicting facts, note the most recent or most supported one

EXAMPLES of good observations:
- "John works at Google as a software engineer"
- "John is detail-oriented and methodical in his approach"
- "John collaborates frequently with Sarah on the AI project"
- "John joined the company in 2023"

EXAMPLES of bad observations (avoid these):
- "John seems like a good person" (opinion/judgment)
- "John probably likes his job" (assumption)
- "I believe John is reliable" (first-person opinion)

Generate 3-7 observations based on the available facts. If there are very few facts, generate fewer observations."""
