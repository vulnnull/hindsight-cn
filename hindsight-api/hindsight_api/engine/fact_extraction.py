## CONTEXT INFORMATION
- Today time: {datetime.utcnow().strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")}
- Current document date/time: {event_date_str}
- Context: {context if context else 'no additional context provided'}{agent_context}

## CORE PRINCIPLE: Extract ALL Meaningful Information Efficiently

**GOAL**: Capture ALL meaningful information, but combine related exchanges efficiently. Don't create separate facts for questions - merge Q&A into single facts.

Each fact should:
1. **CAPTURE ALL MEANINGFUL CONTENT** - Activities, projects, preferences, recommendations, encouragement WITH specific content
2. **BE SELF-CONTAINED** - Readable without the original text
3. **PRESERVE SPECIFIC CONTENT** - Capture WHAT was said, not just THAT something was said
4. **COMBINE Q&A** - A question and its answer = ONE fact, not two separate facts

## COMBINE Q&A - CRITICAL!

**❌ BAD (2 separate facts):**
- "James asks what projects John is working on"
- "John is working on a website for a local small business"

**✅ GOOD (1 combined fact):**
- "John is working on a website for a local small business; it's his first professional project outside of class"

**❌ BAD (question as standalone fact):**
- "James asks John what challenges he has encountered"

**✅ GOOD (merged with answer):**
- "John says payment integration was challenging; he used resources to understand the process and is getting closer to a solution"

## WHAT TO SKIP (only these!)

- **Standalone questions** - merge with answers instead
- **Pure filler with no content** - "Always happy to help", "Sounds good", "Thanks!"
- **Greetings** - "Hey!", "What's up?"

## WHAT TO ALWAYS EXTRACT

- Specific encouragement WITH content: "James says hiccups are normal, use them to learn and grow, push through"
- Reactions that reveal preferences: "John says the art is awesome, takes him back to reading fantasy books"
- Recommendations: "John recommends 'The Name of the Wind' - great novel with awesome writing"
- Plans/intentions: "James will check out 'The Name of the Wind'"
- All activities, projects, purchases, events with details

## ESSENTIAL DETAILS TO PRESERVE - NEVER LOSE THESE

When extracting facts, you MUST preserve:

1. **ALL PARTICIPANTS** - Who said/did what
2. **INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES** - Each person's specific likes/favorites! "Jon's favorite is contemporary because it's expressive" - DO NOT LOSE THIS!
3. **FULL REASONING** - Why decisions were made, motivations, explanations
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT - CRITICAL** - ALWAYS convert relative time references to SPECIFIC ABSOLUTE dates in the fact text!
   - "last week" (doc date Aug 23) → "around August 16, 2023" (NOT just "in August 2023"!)
   - "last month" (doc date Aug 2023) → "in July 2023"
   - "yesterday" (doc date Aug 19) → "on August 18, 2023"
   - "next week" (doc date Aug 19) → "around August 26, 2023"
   - "three days ago" (doc date Aug 19) → "on August 16, 2023"
   - "last year" → "in 2022"
   - BE SPECIFIC! "last week" is NOT "in August" - calculate the actual week!
5. **VISUAL/MEDIA ELEMENTS** - Photos, images, videos shared
6. **MODIFIERS** - "new", "first", "old", "favorite" (critical context)
7. **POSSESSIVE RELATIONSHIPS** - "their kids" → "Person's kids"
8. **BIOGRAPHICAL DETAILS** - Origins, locations, jobs, family background
9. **SOCIAL DYNAMICS** - Nicknames, how people address each other, relationships

## STRUCTURED FACT DIMENSIONS - CRITICAL ⚠️

Each fact MUST be extracted into structured dimensions. This ensures no important context is lost.

### Required field:
- **factual_core**: ACTUAL FACTS - capture WHAT was said, not just THAT something was said!
  - ❌ BAD: "Jon received encouragement from Gina" (loses what Gina actually said)
  - ✅ GOOD: "Gina said Jon is the perfect mentor with positivity and determination; his studio will be a hit"
  - ❌ BAD: "Jon supports Gina" (generic)
  - ✅ GOOD: "Gina found the perfect spot for her store; Jon says her hard work is paying off"
  - Preserve: compliments, assessments, descriptions, predictions, key phrases

### Optional fields (include when present in text):
- **emotional_significance**: Emotions, feelings, personal meaning, AND qualitative descriptors
  - Examples: "felt thrilled", "was her favorite memory", "it's magical", "devastating experience", "proudest moment"
  - Captures: emotions, intensity, personal significance, AND experiential descriptors ("magical", "wonderful", "amazing", "thrilling", "beautiful")

- **reasoning_motivation**: WHY it happened, intentions, goals, causes
  - Examples: "because she wanted to celebrate", "in order to cope with grief", "motivated by curiosity"
  - Captures: reasons, intentions, goals, causal explanations

- **preferences_opinions**: Likes, dislikes, beliefs, values, ideals - CAPTURE EACH PERSON'S SPECIFIC PREFERENCES
  - Examples: "Jon's ideal dance studio is by the water", "Jon's favorite dance is contemporary", "loves coffee", "prefers remote work"
  - Captures: preferences, opinions, beliefs, judgments, ideals, dreams
  - PREFERENCE INDICATORS: "ideal", "favorite", "dream", "perfect", "love", "hate", "prefer" → MUST capture in this dimension!
  - CRITICAL: Never lose individual preferences! "Jon's ideal studio is by the water" must be captured!

- **sensory_details**: Visual, auditory, physical descriptions AND all descriptive adjectives - USE EXACT WORDS!
  - Examples: "bright orange hair", "loud music", "freezing cold", "so graceful", "awesome beach", "epic visuals"
  - Captures: colors, sounds, textures, temperatures, appearances, AND adjectives describing people/things/performances
  - CRITICAL: Use the EXACT adjectives from the text! If they said "awesome" don't write "amazing". If they said "epic" don't write "perfect"!

- **observations**: Things that can be inferred/deduced from the conversation - not explicitly stated but clearly implied
  - TRAVEL: "doing the shoot in Miami" → "Calvin traveled/will travel to Miami"
  - POSSESSION: "my trophy" → "won the trophy"
  - CAPABILITIES: "she coded it" → "knows programming"
  - Examples: "Calvin traveled to Miami for the shoot", "Gina won dance trophies", "knows programming"

### Example extraction:

**Input**: "I used to compete in dance competitions - my fav memory was when my team won first place at regionals at age fifteen. It was an awesome feeling of accomplishment!"

**Output**:
```
factual_core: "Gina's team won first place at a regional dance competition when she was 15"
emotional_significance: "this was her favorite memory; felt an awesome sense of accomplishment"
reasoning_motivation: null
preferences_opinions: null
sensory_details: null
```

### CRITICAL: Never strip away dimensions!
- ❌ BAD: Only extracting factual_core and ignoring emotional context
- ✅ GOOD: Capturing ALL dimensions present in the text

## FACT KIND AND TEMPORAL RULES

### fact_kind determines if occurred dates are set:

**`conversation`** - General info, activities, preferences, ongoing things
- NO occurred_start/end (leave null)
- Examples: "Jon is expanding his studio", "Jon loves dance", "Gina's ideal studio is by water"

**`event`** - Specific datable occurrence (competition, wedding, meeting, trip, loss, start/end of something)
- MUST set occurred_start/end
- Ask: "Is this a SPECIFIC EVENT with a DATE?"
- Examples: "Dance competition on May 15", "Lost job in January 2023", "Wedding next Saturday"

**`other`** - Anything else that doesn't fit above
- NO occurred_start/end (leave null)
- Catch-all to not lose information

### Rules:
1. **ALWAYS include dates in fact text** - "in January 2023", "on May 15, 2024"
2. **Only 'event' gets occurred dates** - conversation and other = null
3. **SPLIT events from conversation facts** - "Jon is expanding his studio (conversation) and hosting a competition next month (event)" → 2 separate facts!

## CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS

When splitting related facts, link them with causal_relations:
- **causes**: This fact causes the target
- **caused_by**: This fact was caused by target
- **enables/prevents**: This fact enables/prevents the target

Only link when there's explicit or clear implicit causation ("because", "so", "therefore").

## FACT TYPE CLASSIFICATION

- **'world'**: Facts about others (third person)
- **'agent'**: Facts about YOU the memory owner (FIRST PERSON: "I did...", "I said...")
- **'opinion'**: Your beliefs/perspectives (first person: "I believe...")

**Speaker attribution**: If context says "Your name: Marcus", only extract 'agent' facts from "Marcus:" lines.

## WHAT TO SKIP
- Greetings, filler words, pure reactions ("wow", "cool")
- Structural statements ("let's get started", "see you next time")
- Calls to action ("subscribe", "follow")

## EXAMPLE: SPLITTING CONVERSATION VS EVENT FACTS

**Input (conversation date: April 3, 2023):**
"I'm expanding my dance studio's social media presence and offering workshops to local schools. I'm also hosting a dance competition next month to showcase local talent. The dancers are so excited!"

**Output (2 facts - conversation + event):**

**Fact 1 (kind=conversation - ongoing activities, no occurred dates):**
```
fact_kind: "conversation"
factual_core: "Jon is expanding his dance studio's social media presence in April 2023; offering workshops and classes to local schools and centers; seeing progress and dancers are excited"
emotional_significance: "excited and proud of progress"
preferences_opinions: "Jon loves giving dancers a place to express themselves"
observations: "Jon owns/runs a dance studio"
occurred_start: null  ← conversation kind = no occurred dates
occurred_end: null
```

**Fact 2 (kind=event - specific datable occurrence):**
```
fact_kind: "event"
factual_core: "Jon will host a dance competition in May 2023 to showcase local talent and bring attention to his studio"
emotional_significance: "excited about the event"
occurred_start: "2023-05-01T00:00:00Z"  ← event kind = HAS occurred dates
occurred_end: "2023-05-31T23:59:59Z"
```

**❌ BAD:** Combining both into one fact with occurred=May (makes ongoing activities look like they happened in May!)

## TEXT TO EXTRACT FROM:
{chunk}

## CRITICAL REMINDERS:
1. **COMBINE Q&A** - Never create standalone question facts! Merge questions with their answers into single facts.
2. **CAPTURE ALL MEANINGFUL CONTENT** - Activities, encouragement (with specific words!), recommendations, reactions, preferences
3. **CONVERT RELATIVE DATES TO SPECIFIC DATES** - "last week" → "around August 16" (NOT "in August"!), "yesterday" → "on August 18". Be precise!
4. **CAPTURE WHAT WAS SAID** - "Gina said Jon is perfect mentor with determination" NOT "Jon received encouragement". Preserve the actual content!
5. **FACT_KIND DETERMINES OCCURRED DATES** - Only 'event' gets occurred_start/end. 'conversation' and 'other' = null
6. **CAPTURE PREFERENCES** - "ideal", "favorite", "love" → preferences_opinions
7. **CAPTURE EXACT ADJECTIVES** - Use the EXACT words! "awesome" not "amazing", "epic" not "perfect" → sensory_details
8. **CAPTURE OBSERVATIONS** - "shooting in Miami" → observations: "traveled to Miami". Infer travel, achievements, capabilities!"""
