/**
 * The first screen of hindsight.vectorize.io.
 *
 * The site root is the docs Overview page, so until this existed the highest
 * traffic page on the site opened on prose: no claim, no number, no call to
 * action.
 *
 * It says three things and nothing else: what Hindsight is, the two things you
 * can do now, and what it actually looks like. The benchmarks used to live here
 * too; they are a section of their own below, because a band carrying both
 * charts ran past 900px and stopped reading as a hero at all.
 *
 * Everything is deliberately container-less apart from the graph — the
 * navbar and sidebar already supply all the chrome this page can carry. An
 * earlier draft had glowing cards behind an aurora and a promo pill, which read
 * as a landing-page template rather than an infrastructure project.
 *
 * The two paths are visually unequal on purpose: Cloud is the commercial
 * conversion and stays the one filled button; GitHub is social proof and sits
 * beside it as a ghost. They are also named apart — "Start free on Cloud" next
 * to "Start free with GitHub" made "GitHub" mean two different things.
 *
 * It lives in src/components rather than in the page body because the page is
 * versioned: production serves versioned_docs/version-0.10/developer/index.mdx.
 * A component keeps each version's include to one line.

     The sidebar is a sibling of <main>, so CSS alone cannot push it below
     something nested inside main: this reports the height it has to clear —
     the hero plus everything else marked .hs-full-bleed under it, since those
     run edge to edge too. Measured rather than hard-coded because the content
     rewraps with the viewport. The page itself is matched in custom.css by the
