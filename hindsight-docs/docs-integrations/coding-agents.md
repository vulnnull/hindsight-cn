Long-term project memory for **coding agents**, backed by [Hindsight](https://vectorize.io/hindsight).
One package, several agents: a shared reflect-and-inject core with a thin entry point per agent
(**opencode**, **Kilo CLI**, **Cline CLI**, **Claude Code**, **Codex CLI**, **Antigravity CLI**, **Cursor CLI**, **GitHub Copilot CLI**, **Grok Build**). Ingestion is fully
automatic — there is no setup command: a repo's git history and conversations flow into its memory
bank in the background as you work.

The premise: most of a real fix is derivable from the code, but the _last mile_ often hinges on a
project-specific decision that isn't in the code at all — a rounding rule, a retry allowlist, a
tie-break policy. Those decisions live in git history and past conversations. This package puts them
in front of the agent at the moment it starts working, and keeps a curated set of **knowledge pages**
(architecture, conventions, in-flight initiatives) that future sessions start from.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @vectorize-io/hindsight-coding-agents
hindsight-coding-agents install all          # every detected agent, wired natively
hindsight-coding-agents install claude-code  # or just one
hindsight-coding-agents uninstall all        # removes exactly what install added
```

`install` takes an explicit target — `all`, or one or more harness names. A bare
`hindsight-coding-agents install` changes nothing and prints the choice, so wiring every agent on
the machine is never something that happens by accident.

### Per agent

Same command, only the harness name changes. Run after installing the package globally.

| agent              | command                                       | what it wires                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Claude Code        | `hindsight-coding-agents install claude-code` | 3 hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json` + MCP (`claude mcp add`, user scope) + companion skill      |
| opencode           | `hindsight-coding-agents install opencode`    | plugin entry in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (native tools, no MCP needed)                 |
| Kilo CLI           | `hindsight-coding-agents install kilo`        | plugin entry in `~/.config/kilo/kilo.json[c]`                                                    |
| Codex CLI          | `hindsight-coding-agents install codex`       | 3 hooks in `~/.codex/hooks.json` + `[mcp_servers]` in `config.toml` (needs `codex_hooks = true`) |
| Cursor CLI         | `hindsight-coding-agents install cursor-cli`  | hooks in `~/.cursor/hooks.json` + `~/.cursor/mcp.json` + skill                                   |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | `hindsight-coding-agents install copilot-cli` | `~/.copilot/hooks/` + `mcp-config.json` + skill                                                  |
| Grok Build         | `hindsight-coding-agents install grok-build`  | native hooks + MCP in `~/.grok/config.toml` + skill                                              |
| Antigravity CLI    | `hindsight-coding-agents install agy`         | lifecycle hooks + MCP + the `Hindsight · <bank>` status line                                     |
| Devin CLI          | `hindsight-coding-agents install devin-cli`   | hooks in `~/.config/devin/config.json` + MCP (needs Node 22.5+, see below)                       |
| Cline CLI          | `hindsight-coding-agents install cline-cli`   | native plugin via `cline plugin install` + MCP + skill                                           |

Uninstall the same way: `hindsight-coding-agents uninstall claude-code` (or `uninstall all`).

**Devin CLI needs Node 22.5 or newer.** Its hooks pass only a session id — the conversation itself
lives in `~/.local/share/devin/cli/sessions.db` — so reading it depends on Node's built-in
`node:sqlite`. Installing `devin-cli` checks for this first and refuses (with the reason) rather
than wiring hooks that could never retain anything. Every other agent works on any supported Node.

Install globally (not `npx`): the wiring points at this package's files, so it must live at a
stable path — the installer refuses to run from an npx cache. **Updating** is just
`npm update -g @vectorize-io/hindsight-coding-agents`: the wired paths stay valid, every new session runs the
new version; re-run `install` (idempotent) only when a release note says the wiring changed.

`install` merges the native wiring (hooks + MCP registration where the host wants them) into each
agent's own config, preserving everything already there; it is idempotent (re-run after moving the
package) and backs up any pre-existing file it touches as `<file>.hindsight-backup`. `uninstall`
removes only our entries. On Claude Code the install also ships a **companion skill**
(`~/.claude/skills/hindsight-coding-agent`) that teaches the agent how this memory works — what
"store this in hindsight" should do, the tool surface, per-repo configuration, debugging — so users
can ask the agent itself. Manual wiring per harness, if you prefer:

**opencode** installs directly — point `opencode.json` at the package dir:

```json
{ "plugin": ["/path/to/hindsight-coding-agents"] }
```

**Claude Code** and **Codex** get their full three-hook + MCP wiring from this package's own
installer — `hindsight-coding-agents install claude-code` / `install codex`. This package's `bin`
entries (`hindsight-claude-hook`, `hindsight-codex-hook`,
`hindsight-cursor-hook`) are the individual injection-only `UserPromptSubmit` entrypoints for a
minimal, hand-wired setup.

Adding an agent: hook-based → write a `HookSpec` entry point (see `src/cursor-hook.ts`) and register
a `hookAdapter` in `src/harness/registry.ts`; persistent-plugin → implement `HarnessAdapter`
(`src/core/types.ts`) fully (see `src/harness/opencode.ts`).

## Migrating from the per-agent plugins

The older per-agent integrations (`hindsight-claude-code`, `hindsight-cursor-cli`, `hindsight-codex`, …) are superseded by this package. Their memory does **not** carry over automatically, and it cannot be merged:

- They scope a bank **per agent per project** (`claude-code::myrepo`); this package uses one **per repo** (`coding-agent::myrepo`) so every agent shares it. Two old banks map onto one new one.
- The server restores a whole bank rather than merging into an existing one, so the old bank can't be folded in.

Instead, re-import the conversations the agent already wrote to disk — they get re-extracted into the current bank:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/repo
hindsight-coding-agents install claude-code --import-conversations
```

**How sessions are matched.** A conversation is imported only when the session itself records the
directory it ran in — never inferred from a file or folder name. Claude Code writes that directory
on its entries and Codex in its `session_meta` header, so both can be attributed exactly, including
sessions started in a subdirectory of the repo. Guessing was tempting (Claude names its history
folders after the project path) but unsafe: `/` and `.` both encode to `-`, so `repo-sub` is either
the subdirectory `repo/sub` or an unrelated sibling repo — and a wrong guess files someone else's
conversation into your bank. Sessions that record nothing are skipped and the count is reported.
The other harnesses (opencode, Kilo, Cursor, Cline, Copilot, Devin) keep history in internal SQLite
databases with unversioned schemas and are skipped with a reason.

The import is scoped to the **current repo**, safe to re-run (ingestion dedups by document id), and
runs extraction — so it costs tokens roughly in proportion to the history imported.

Prefer to keep the old bank instead? Point this package at it — no data moves:

```jsonc
{ "bankIdTemplate": "{harness}::{gitProject}" } // reproduces the old per-agent naming
```

## How it works

**Ingestion — automatic, no command to run**

- On a **cold repo**, the first session kicks off a background seed: recent commit **messages** as one cheap document, plus a short headless **codebase survey** to map the structure.
- On **every** session, a background "deepen" pass ingests conversations not yet stored and the next batch of recent commits **with full diffs, newest first** — precision arrives across sessions instead of one big ingest.
- Repeated or concurrent runs are a no-op (per-bank lock + document-id dedup).
- Ask the agent `hindsight_sync_status` to see where ingestion stands — `synced: true` means everything is queryable.

**In the session — what the agent actually receives**

- On the first prompt, a **reflect** call returns the past decision behind the task, with its exact rule and values. It's cached and re-injected each turn.
- Every turn, the repo's **knowledge pages** are matched locally against the prompt (lexical index — no server call, no LLM, ~ms) and the best sections are injected with provenance. Below a relevance floor, nothing is injected.
- The agent also gets the page roster and the `hindsight_*` tools, so it can read a page, search raw memory, or record a new initiative itself.
- Injected memory carries a visible-attribution directive, so the agent shows a `🧠 Using Hindsight Memories` header when memory shaped its answer.

**Write-back — sessions become memory**

- The live session is stored as a transcript: user/assistant turns plus a compact `action` line per tool call (name + target, no arguments or output) — decisions without the mechanical noise.
- Hook harnesses write on `Stop`. Plugin harnesses (opencode, Kilo) write on a turn cadence **and** when the session goes idle — the idle pass is what captures the agent's own reply, which the per-turn pass runs too early to see.

**Guarantees**

- A failed reflect or page fetch degrades to a no-memory turn; it never breaks the agent.
- It never fails _silently_ either: every outcome is written to a diagnostics file, so a memory-less session can't pass for a memory session.
- When two memories conflict on the same rule, the later decision wins and the superseded one is reported as no longer in effect.
- Against a Hindsight server that predates knowledge pages, page features are skipped (recorded as `knowledge_pages_unavailable`) and everything else continues.

## Harnesses

Every harness runs the same surface (seed → session reflect → per-turn page sections → knowledge
tools → write-back); they differ only in how that surface is delivered.

| harness                   | kind              | lifecycle wiring                                                                                                                   | install                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `opencode`                | persistent plugin | one process: load-time seed, session reflect + page sections, native tools, write-back                                             | add the package dir to `opencode.json` → `"plugin": [...]`          |
| `kilo`                    | persistent plugin | identical to `opencode` — Kilo CLI is an opencode fork, so it loads the same runtime (no hooks system)                             | `hindsight-coding-agents install kilo` → `kilo.json[c]` `"plugin"`  |
| `claude-code`             | per-prompt hooks  | `SessionStart` (seed) + `UserPromptSubmit` (reflect + pages) + `Stop` (write-back) + MCP                                           | `hindsight-coding-agents install claude-code`                       |
| `codex`                   | per-prompt hooks  | same three hooks in `~/.codex/hooks.json` (+ `codex_hooks = true`, CLI ≥ 0.116)                                                    | `hindsight-coding-agents install codex`                             |
| `antigravity-cli` (`agy`) | lifecycle hooks   | Antigravity CLI lifecycle hooks (`PreInvocation` + `Stop`) + MCP, plus a native colored `Hindsight · <bank>` status-line indicator | `hindsight-coding-agents install agy`                               |
| `cursor-cli`              | lifecycle hooks   | `sessionStart` (seed + pages) + `beforeSubmitPrompt` (reflect) + `stop` (write-back)                                               | hooks in Cursor `hooks.json`                                        |
| `copilot-cli`             | lifecycle hooks   | `sessionStart` (seed + pages) + `userPromptTransformed` (reflect) + `agentStop` (write-back) + MCP                                 | `~/.copilot/hooks/hindsight-coding-agents.json` + `mcp-config.json` |
| `grok-build`              | lifecycle hooks   | `SessionStart` (seed) + `Stop` (write-back) + MCP                                                                                  | native `~/.grok/config.toml` — no Claude Code dependency            |
| `cline-cli`               | persistent plugin | native `beforeModel` (seed/reflect/pages) + `afterRun` (write-back) + MCP                                                          | `cline plugin install` (run by the installer)                       |

The hook-based harnesses share one runtime (`src/core/hook.ts`) plus their SessionStart/Stop
entrypoints. Persistent-plugin hosts (opencode/Kilo/Cline) delegate to the same `RuntimeCore`,
which in turn calls those shared session-start, prompt, and retain operations; only their host API
adapters differ. Opencode and Kilo can register the knowledge tools natively; Cline uses the shared
MCP server. All support opt-in **incremental git-sync** (retain commits new since the seed on load).

Antigravity renders the Hindsight indicator with its documented custom status-line command. It is
local and never calls the Hindsight API while the TUI redraws. If you already configured an
Antigravity custom status line, the installer leaves it untouched rather than replacing it.

### Grok Build limitation

Grok Build executes `UserPromptSubmit` hooks but ignores their stdout. Hindsight can therefore not
inject a reflect result, memory block, or banner into Grok's model-visible conversation. Grok still
gets native bank setup and transcript retention plus Hindsight MCP tools and the companion skill;
ask it to call `hindsight_reflect` or `hindsight_search_knowledge_pages` when needed. Automatic
injection requires a future Grok prompt-transform API.

### Cline CLI scope

Cline's external file hooks cannot alter a model request, so Hindsight uses Cline's native plugin
API instead. Its `beforeModel` hook injects the shared reflect/page context and
its `afterRun` hook upserts Cline's runtime transcript. `hindsight-coding-agents install cline-cli`
runs `cline plugin install --force <package-path>` and configures MCP plus the companion skill.
Cline CLI sandboxes plugin hooks with a three-second limit, so a slow first reflect finishes in the
background and is injected on a subsequent model call or turn rather than aborting the session.
Its write-back retains only user-visible user/assistant text; tool arguments, tool results and
command output, tool-role messages, reasoning parts, and Hindsight's injected context are excluded.
Cline IDE extensions are not currently supported by this CLI integration.

## Configuration

Configuration is **one JSON file**: `~/.hindsight/coding-agent.json`. Layering, later wins per field:

1. built-in defaults
2. environment variables — `HINDSIGHT_API_URL`, `HINDSIGHT_API_TOKEN`, and one per scalar setting
   (`HINDSIGHT_<FIELD_IN_CAPS>`), for containers and CI that inject config rather than write a file
3. the file's top level
4. its `harnesses.<name>` section — per-agent override

Environment variables are a **fallback**: the file wins wherever it sets a value, so adding env to
an existing setup changes nothing. The map-valued settings (`mapPathToBank`, `harnesses`, `banks`)
are file-only — nested branching doesn't survive flattening into one variable.

There is deliberately no repo-carried config file — per-repo bank routing is `mapPathToBank`,
per-agent differences are `harnesses.<name>`.

Each entry point knows which harness it _is_ (the opencode plugin is loaded by opencode, the codex
hook by Codex...), so one shared config serves several agents side by side:

```jsonc
{
  "apiUrl": "https://api.hindsight.vectorize.io",
  "harnesses": {
    "opencode": { "reflectTimeoutMs": 60000 },
    "claude-code": { "disabled": true }, // e.g. memory off for Claude only
  },
}
```

### Per-repo opt-in/out — `banks.<bankId>`

Per-repo control lives in the SAME file, keyed by the **resolved bank id** (shown in the session
banner) and applied AFTER bank resolution — so it works regardless of where the repo lives, and
survives directory moves:

```jsonc
{
  "banks": {
    "coding-agent::secret-client": { "disabled": true }, // blacklist: no memory at all
    "coding-agent::old-name": { "bank": "team::shared" }, // rename / converge banks
    "coding-agent::big-mono": { "gitIngest": "full", "retainSessions": false },
  },
}
```

Any behavioral field can be overridden per bank, and `bank` **renames the destination** (single
hop: the section is selected by the resolved id, the target is literal — several ids may converge
on one shared bank, and the target's own section is not consulted). Other bank-resolution fields
are ignored inside a bank section.

#### Recipe: two repos, one shared bank

Two ways, by what the natural key is:

**By resolved id** — you know the repo names; works wherever the repos live (and keeps working if
they move). Both ids converge on one literal target:

```jsonc
{
  "banks": {
    "coding-agent::backend": { "bank": "team::product" },
    "coding-agent::frontend": { "bank": "team::product" },
  },
}
```

**By path prefix** — the repos live under one directory; a single `mapPathToBank` entry covers
every repo (present and future) beneath it:

```jsonc
{
  "mapPathToBank": { "/Users/me/work/client-x": "client-x-memory" },
}
```

Rule of thumb: converge by **id** for a hand-picked set of repos; map by **path** when a folder is
the boundary ("everything I clone under `work/client-x` shares memory").

### Bank resolution

Coding memory is **per repository**. Resolution order for the working directory:

1. `mapPathToBank` — longest matching absolute-path prefix (mapping a repo root covers every
   subdirectory; deeper mappings win; overrides even an explicit `bankId`).
2. Static — `bankId` set (or `dynamicBankId: false`).
3. Dynamic — `bankIdTemplate` with placeholders:
   - `{gitProject}` — worktree-aware repo name: `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` resolves every
     linked worktree to the **main** worktree's basename, so all worktrees of a repo share one bank
     (bare repos use the bare dir name; non-git directories fall back to the dir basename)
   - `{project}` — plain working-directory basename
   - `{harness}` — the entry point asking (`opencode`, `claude-code`, `codex`, `antigravity-cli`, `cursor-cli`, `copilot-cli`)
   - `{channel}` / `{user}` — `$HINDSIGHT_CHANNEL_ID` / `$HINDSIGHT_USER_ID`

The default `"coding-agent::{gitProject}"` is **harness-neutral**, so opencode, Claude Code, and Codex
all share one memory per repo — use `"{harness}-{gitProject}"` to split per agent instead.

## Ingestion internals (no CLI)

There is no user-facing ingest command — the deepen engine (`dist/deepen.js`) is spawned by every
session start and does only the missing work: bank configuration, conversation import (dedup by
document id), the one-time gitlog seed, the next per-commit diff batch (newest first, bounded per
run), then knowledge pages once extraction has drained. Harnesses that need deterministic ingestion
(benchmarks, e2e suites) run the same engine directly and poll `dist/status.js` until
`"synced": true` — the exact readiness contract the `hindsight_sync_status` agent tool reports.

Past-conversation import accepts a normalized interchange file (engine `--conversations` flag):
`[{ "id": "s1", "turns": [{ "role": "user", "text": "...", "timestamp?": "ISO" }, ...] }, ...]`,
chronological (a later chat can amend an earlier one). Day-to-day, conversations simply accrue from
the live session write-back — no export step.

Local Hindsight for trying it out:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -p 9999:9999 -e HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=gemini \
  -e HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_API_KEY=$GEMINI_API_KEY -e HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash \
  ghcr.io/vectorize-io/hindsight:latest
```

## Diagnostics & logging

Two files, two audiences:

**Leveled plugin log** (humans debugging): `$TMPDIR/hindsight-coding-agent/plugin.log` (override
`HINDSIGHT_LOG_FILE`) — timestamped `LEVEL [scope] message` lines from every component, including
the ingestion engine. Level defaults to `info`; set `"logLevel": "debug"` in config or
`HINDSIGHT_LOG_LEVEL=debug` for ad-hoc debugging (at `debug`, every diag event below is mirrored
here too, so one file tells the whole story).

**Structured diag events** (machines/harnesses): every reflect and page-fetch outcome is appended
as a JSON line to `/tmp/hindsight-plugin.log` (override with `HINDSIGHT_DIAG_FILE`):

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-07-27T07:05:52Z",
  "harness": "claude-code",
  "event": "reflect_ok",
  "ms": 14210,
  "chars": 792,
  "query": "..."
}
```

`reflect_failed` / `pages_failed` record the error; if you're comparing memory-on vs memory-off,
check this file — a run whose reflects failed is a no-memory run. Seed starts are logged as
`seed_started`.
