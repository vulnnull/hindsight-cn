"""Pure-ASGI HTTP observability: request metrics, and the ignored-params header.

This replaces two ``@app.middleware("http")`` handlers. That decorator installs a
Starlette ``BaseHTTPMiddleware``, which per request spawns a child task and pipes
the response through a pair of anyio memory-object streams. Measured against the
real API on a 2-CPU container at 32 concurrent clients, removing the two of them
took ``/health/live`` from ~1500 to ~5100 rps (p99 159ms -> 33ms) while *lowering*
CPU from a saturated core to ~65% -- the cost is scheduling hops, not compute, so
it grows exactly when the event loop is already contended.

A pure-ASGI middleware has no such overhead: it is one ``await`` in the same task,
wrapping ``send`` to observe the response.

Two responsibilities live here because both need the same hook -- the moment the
response status is known:

* record the request metrics (what ``http_metrics_middleware`` did), labelled by the
  template of the route the request hits (see :func:`http_endpoint_label`);
* attach ``X-Ignored-Params`` when the route stashed unknown parameters on the
  scope (see :mod:`hindsight_api.api.unknown_params`). Doing it here rather than
  in the route keeps the header on error responses too, which is what the old
  middleware did -- a route handler cannot add a header to a response produced by
  an exception handler above it.
