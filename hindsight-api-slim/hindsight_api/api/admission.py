"""Admission control: bound the wait, not just the concurrency.

The engine already limits concurrent work (``recall_max_concurrent`` and friends),
but a bare ``async with semaphore`` is *backpressure*, not admission control: it
caps how much runs at once and lets an unbounded queue form behind it. Measured on
a 2-vCPU container, 1024 concurrent recalls against a 32-permit semaphore produced
a 12.8s p50 — the latency did not go away, it moved from the event loop into the
semaphore queue, and the server spent CPU on responses whose clients had long
since given up.

What is missing is a bound on *waiting*. A lane here has two numbers:

* ``max_in_flight`` — how much of this operation runs concurrently;
* ``max_wait_seconds`` — how long a request may queue before it is refused.

A request that cannot be admitted within its deadline gets 503 with ``Retry-After``
immediately, which is a far better answer than a response that arrives after the
caller timed out. Capacity is unchanged; what changes is that the capacity stops
being spent on work nobody is waiting for.

**Where this runs.** As a FastAPI dependency on the same routes that carry
``precheck_for``, so a rejection happens *before the request body is deserialised*
— the cheapest possible point to say no, and the same place an extension already
rejects on quota.

**Why a lane per operation rather than one global limit.** Per-request cost spans
three orders of magnitude on this API (measured: ~0.1ms for ``/health/live``,
~0.5ms for bank stats, ~23ms for a recall). A single global request cap calibrated
for recall would throttle health checks that the server can serve 100x faster; one
calibrated for health would never engage for recall. The operations worth limiting
are exactly the ones :class:`PrecheckOperation` already enumerates.

**The limits are PER WORKER PROCESS.** Each ``--workers N`` process imports the app
and builds its own controller, so the process-wide budget is ``N x max_in_flight``.
Size a lane for one worker, not for the cluster.

A plain ``asyncio.Semaphore`` is correct here because one process runs one event
loop. (It would not be under ``--event-loops > 1`` on a free-threaded build, where
each loop would get its own semaphore and admit N times the limit — if multi-loop
serving ever comes back, this needs ``CrossLoopSemaphore`` instead.) The semaphore
is constructed before any loop is running, which is fine on 3.10+: it binds lazily
on first await, not at construction.
