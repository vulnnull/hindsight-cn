"""Recognising a write the worker should bring back later rather than fail.

Two shapes of that answer live here: a store shedding under its own indexing backlog
(`is_store_backpressure`) and an append that lost the race on the document it extends
(`is_append_conflict`). Neither says anything about the payload, and both clear on their own, so
both are deferred instead of counting against the operation's retries.

A store under sustained ingest can refuse a write because its own indexing has fallen behind —
not because the request is bad, not because anything is broken, and not in a way that says
anything about the payload. It is `UNAVAILABLE` in the gRPC sense: retryable, and self-clearing as
soon as the store catches up.

Treated as an ordinary failure it is none of those things. The worker gives a failing task a small
number of attempts over a few minutes, so a long ingest whose backlog takes longer than that to
drain exhausts them while the store is still legitimately shedding, and the operation is marked
permanently `failed`. Ingesting a large corpus then loses whichever documents happened to be in
flight when the backlog crossed the bound — the tail of the run, silently, with a `failed` row
that reads like the content was at fault.

So it is classified as backpressure and deferred instead (`DeferOperation`: "not yet, try later",
no `retry_count` bump), which is what the store is actually asking for.

Matched on the message rather than on a typed error because the store speaks gRPC and the
provider re-raises `AioRpcError`; there is no shared exception class to catch, and inventing one
would mean a coordinated change across the store's client. The strings below are the store's own
refusal text, and a false positive costs a deferral rather than a lost operation — a task that is
genuinely broken still fails on its next attempt, when the message no longer matches.

    A lost race is the opposite of a fatal error: the precondition rejects the write whole, so
    nothing was stored, and redoing it on a fresh read is always safe. Failing it terminally —
    which is what the worker does with any other exception — drops the turn it carried.

    Walks the cause/context chain like `is_store_backpressure`, since the conflict is usually
    wrapped by the time the worker sees it. Matched on the exception type here, not the message:
    unlike the store's gRPC refusal, both of these are our own classes.
