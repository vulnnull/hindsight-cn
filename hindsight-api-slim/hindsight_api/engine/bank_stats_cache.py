"""TTL + coalescing cache for `get_bank_stats`.

`get_bank_stats` aggregates over `memory_links` (and joins to `memory_units`),
which can be a multi-second parallel sequential scan on banks with millions of
rows. The result is intentionally approximate (it powers a UI widget and a
freshness hint inside `reflect`), so caching it for a few tens of seconds is
safe and dramatically reduces planner-driven thrash from clients that poll.

The cache also coalesces concurrent misses on the same key onto a single
in-flight task so that N concurrent callers produce one query rather than N.

    Same ``get_or_load`` / ``invalidate`` / ``clear`` contract as
    :class:`BankStatsCache`, but the store is the per-schema ``bank_stats_cache``
    table instead of a per-process dict — so one worker's computation is shared
    with every other worker, and no caller recomputes while a fresh row exists.

    On a hit, a call is a single primary-key ``SELECT`` (sub-millisecond); only a
    miss runs the (expensive) ``loader`` and writes the row back. Concurrent
    misses are *not* coalesced across processes (that would need a lock): they
    each compute and ``UPSERT``, last write wins — all results are correct, at the
    cost of a brief redundant compute at expiry.

    Every DB touch is best-effort: if the cache table is unreachable or missing
    (e.g. a schema mid-migration), the call degrades to computing without caching
    rather than failing ``get_bank_stats``. PostgreSQL only — the engine keeps the
    in-process :class:`BankStatsCache` for Oracle.
