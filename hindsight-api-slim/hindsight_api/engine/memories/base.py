"""Extension interface for the *memories* slice of storage.

`memory_units` and the link tables around it (`memory_links`, `unit_entities`)
are the one part of the schema that is a search index as much as a table: every
recall arm — semantic, BM25, graph, temporal — is a query over them. This module
carves that slice out from behind the raw SQL so a different engine can own it,
without touching how documents, chunks, banks, operations or the entity registry
are stored.

The default :class:`~hindsight_api.engine.memories.postgres.PostgresMemories`
keeps everything exactly where it has always been: rows in `memory_units`, links
in `memory_links` and `unit_entities`, retrieval as SQL. It is what runs unless
an extension is configured, and it is the implementation the test suite
exercises.

An alternative implementation is loaded like any other Hindsight extension::

    HINDSIGHT_API_MEMORIES_EXTENSION=mypackage.memories:MyMemories
    HINDSIGHT_API_MEMORIES_SOME_SETTING=value

Such an implementation is the **sole store** for memories: no memory- or
link-shaped row reaches Postgres at all. Unit ids are minted by
:meth:`MemoriesExtension.allocate_unit_ids` rather than by an INSERT's RETURNING
clause, facts carry their entity ids and causal edges inline instead of becoming
join rows, and recall results come back fully populated with no Postgres
hydration. Everything else — documents, chunks, banks, the `entities` registry —
stays in Postgres either way.

Most operations are a method here, so the call chains route through the interface
rather than reimplement it per store; where the two differ, they usually differ by
what the method does — the Postgres implementation writes join rows and reprocesses
links, one that owns the store no-ops those passes and does its own thing. A handful
of call sites still branch on the one capability flag, ``store_owned`` — whether the
store owns its writes or the caller issues them as SQL — where the shapes are
genuinely different; those are the seams, not accidental leaks.

    #:
    #: False (the default) is the SQL stores, Postgres and Oracle, and nothing about how they work

    #: / ``count_chunks`` / ``document_content_hash``), resolves entity NAMES itself, and commits the

        A store that indexes everything regardless ignores them, which is what the default does —

          ``entity_ids`` is ignored.
        * ``entity_ids`` — the already-resolved set, for a store whose registry is
          the host's SQL (the host minted them and, for a join-table store, has

        the memory (rather than in a global join table) needs to know which
        namespace the units live in — the Postgres join is keyed by global unit id
        and ignores it.

        an earlier :meth:`insert_facts` created, so it must be idempotent: it is
        reached again whenever a retain re-resolves the same batch's entities.
