"""The engine's curation and bank-admin SQL: deletes, requeues, history and entity lookups.

These back :class:`~hindsight_api.engine.memory_engine.MemoryEngine` methods that used to
run this SQL inline — deleting one or many memories, clearing or deleting a bank, clearing
observations, retrying failed consolidation, an observation's history, the entity graph and
the entity detail view. The SQL is lifted verbatim from those methods; only the connection,
the dialect ``ops`` and the ``fq_table`` resolver are now parameters. Authentication, the
