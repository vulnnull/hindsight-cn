"""The memories store: which one is installed, and how the engine reaches it.

Resolved through the ordinary extension loader — ``HINDSIGHT_API_MEMORIES_EXTENSION``

this behaves like every other extension point. Unset (the normal case) means
:class:`~hindsight_api.engine.memories.postgres.PostgresMemories`: rows in
`memory_units`, links in `memory_links` / `unit_entities`, retrieval as SQL.
