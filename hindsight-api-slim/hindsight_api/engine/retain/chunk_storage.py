    The SQL store keeps ``chunk_id`` as a column; a store that keeps memories outside SQL

    so the two are read differently. Only ``experience``/``world`` units are returned:
    observations are not chunk-scoped, and feeding one back as a *source* id would be
    meaningless. Paged to exhaustion — every id is about to be deleted, and a chunk whose
    facts overflow one page must not keep half of them.

    ``store`` is the provider the caller already resolved for this bank. A caller inside a
    store-owned path has it in hand, and passing it is what keeps this from re-deciding ownership
    against the global registry: that registry answers for the PROCESS, and a router serving both
    kinds of bank would send a store-owned delta down the SQL branch -- reading with the connection
    that path deliberately never acquired.
