"""Extra ids a bank answers to, and the one place they become the real id.

Why this exists
---------------
``bank_id`` is a TEXT primary key and the foreign key in every bank-scoped table,
so changing it means rewriting every row and stopping the bank's clients first
(``hindsight-admin rename-bank``). An alias gives the same outcome without the
stop: the bank keeps its id and its rows, and additionally answers to a new one,
so callers move over in phases.

Why resolution happens at the HTTP edge
---------------------------------------
Roughly 337 ``WHERE bank_id = $1`` queries span 36 modules. Resolving deeper --
say in ``_ensure_bank_exists`` -- would leave all of them keyed on the alias, so
the id has to become canonical *before* anything reads it. See
``api/unknown_params.py``, which rewrites the path param for every bank endpoint
at once. Everything below that point only ever sees a real ``bank_id``, and no
row anywhere is stored under an alias.

Resolution order: a real bank always wins
-----------------------------------------
:func:`resolve` consults ``banks`` first and ``bank_aliases`` only on a miss, so
an alias can never shadow an existing bank. That ordering is also what makes the
one unclosed race safe -- see :func:`create_alias`.

An unknown id resolves to itself, so behaviour for every id that is not an alias
(including retain's lazy auto-create) is exactly what it was before.
