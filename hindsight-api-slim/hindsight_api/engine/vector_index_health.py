"""Per-bank vector index coverage: what a bank should have, and making it so.

``HINDSIGHT_API_VECTOR_INDEX_MIN_ROWS`` decides how coverage is reached, and its
default of ``0`` means nothing in this module runs at all. At ``0`` the three
partial indexes are built in the bank-create transaction and dropped when the
bank is deleted — the behaviour that predates the threshold, and still the right
one for a deployment whose bank count is not the problem.

A deployment holding thousands of banks sets a positive threshold, because these
indexes live on the shared ``memory_units`` table: PostgreSQL locks and plans
against every index on a relation, and opens every one for each DML statement, so
one bank's index is charged to every other bank's queries. Three per bank
exhausts the lock table at a few thousand banks (issue #3485). Above the
threshold a partition earns its own index; below it the planner answers the same
query from the ``(bank_id, fact_type)`` B-tree plus a top-N sort, which is exact
rather than approximate and faster.

With a threshold set, coverage is reconciled by the ``vector_index_maintenance``
async operation (submitted after a write that could have changed it) and by the
``repair-bank`` admin command. Neither runs on a request path. The write path
pays only :func:`plan_bank_vector_indexes`, which is kept cheap two ways: the
:class:`CoverageTrigger` direction settles most partitions from the catalog
without counting anything, and what is left is counted no further than the
threshold rather than exactly.

All DDL is ``CREATE/DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY`` on a raw autocommit connection, so
it never takes ``ACCESS EXCLUSIVE`` on the shared table. That is also what keeps
the drop path usable on an instance that has already hit the #3485 wall:
``DROP INDEX`` is a utility statement that locks its own index plus the table,
rather than planning against all of the table's indexes the way any DML must.
