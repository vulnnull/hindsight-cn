"""retain_params must round-trip whatever the caller supplied.

reprocess_document rebuilds its retain call entirely from documents.retain_params.
The inclusion list this replaces dropped three fields in turn — `strategy`,
`entities`, `resolve_entities` — each written by api_retain and never captured, so
a reprocess re-extracted under the bank's default strategy with entity resolution
it had been told not to do. Every one was invisible: the reprocess succeeds and
only the resulting facts are wrong.

The rule is now an exclusion list, so a new retain field round-trips unless
somebody deliberately excludes it, and api_retain's content dict is the single
source of truth for what gets replayed.
