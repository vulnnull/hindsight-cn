"""A documented retrieval baseline: nDCG and friends on BEIR SciFact.

The only suite here graded against labels nobody in this repo wrote, and the only
one that makes **no model call**. Every other eval judges an answer with an LLM;
this one scores `recall` against BEIR SciFact's own relevance judgements —
scientific claims as queries, abstracts as documents — and reports the standard
set at k = 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 100: nDCG, MAP, Recall, P, MRR and Hit, plus
untruncated MRR and R-precision. Definitions follow `pytrec_eval`, which is what
BEIR itself scores with, and `tests/test_retrieval_metrics.py` cross-checks every
one of them against it.

**This records a baseline; it does not gate CI.** It lives in `system-evals`,
which runs on perf-test's nightly cron rather than on pull requests, and the
floors below exist so a nightly run says something when retrieval moves — not so
a merge is blocked. The numbers and how they were measured are in the block above
the floors, which is the point of the file: somewhere to look up what this
pipeline scored, and on what.

It is also the one suite here that needs no credentials, because the memories
were extracted once by a real model and frozen as
`fixtures/beir-scifact-bank.zip` (500 abstracts -> 1,812 memories). The story
restores that archive instead of retaining, so nothing calls an LLM:

    HINDSIGHT_EVAL_LLM_PROVIDER=none HINDSIGHT_EVAL_LLM_MODEL=none \
      uv run pytest tests evals/test_08_retrieval_metrics.py

It stays in `system-evals` rather than `system-tests` for one reason: that suite
stubs the embedder AND the reranker with lexical stand-ins, and an nDCG measured
over hashed word overlap is a fact about blake2b. The models this grades have to
be the ones that ship, which is what `system-evals` already runs.

Two facts about `recall` shape the scoring. It returns facts, several per
document, while a qrel labels a document — so units are collapsed onto their
source at the rank of the best-placed one. And it takes no `k`, budgeting by
`max_tokens` — so the list is widened with tokens and cut at k in the scorer.

#:
#: **The run-to-run spread is real and not yet explained.** Runs land in one of
#: two states, never between them. What is ruled out, by measurement rather than
#: by argument: it is not a partial restore (the memory count reaches 1,812 either
#: way), not embedding lag (the numbers do not converge if you wait — a probe
#: query is stable within a session from the first reading), not ANN recall
#: (deferring the vector index so every search is exact does not remove it), and
#: not CPU-vs-MPS float drift (forcing both models onto CPU does not remove it).
#:
#: A trace comparison across fresh sessions shows the per-arm candidate COUNTS are
#: identical every time — semantic 1000, bm25 87, graph 360 — while the documents
#: that survive differ by a few. Identical pool sizes with different membership
#: points at the import rather than at retrieval: entity links are rebuilt on
#: restore and feed the graph arm. That is a hypothesis, not a finding.
#:
#: So the floors sit below the LOWER state, which is the honest thing to assert
#: until the spread is understood: this still catches a real regression (anything
#: that drops ranking by more than ~5%) without firing on the spread itself.
#: Tighten them to the upper state once a run is reproducible — worth doing,
#: because until then this detects far less than the numbers suggest it could.
#:
#: NOT comparable to a published SciFact nDCG@10 (~0.70 for a strong dense
#: retriever): that is 5,183 abstracts, this is 500, and this ranks extracted
#: claims rather than the abstracts themselves.
