 * hindsight-codebuddy-hook - the CodeBuddy Code entry point (a `UserPromptSubmit` hook).
 *
 * Install (CodeBuddy, user scope): ~/.codebuddy/settings.json
 *   { "hooks": { "UserPromptSubmit": [ { "hooks": [
 *       { "type": "command", "command": "node \"…/codebuddy-hook.js\"", "timeout": 30 } ] } ] } }
 *
 * CodeBuddy Code runs the SAME `@genie/agent-cli` engine as WorkBuddy — WorkBuddy ships that engine
 * with its home folder set to `.workbuddy` by product config, CodeBuddy uses the default
 * `~/.codebuddy` — so it speaks Claude Code's hook protocol (two quirks handled by
 * genieSessionStart/geniePrompt) and uses the shared hook runtime: recall every prompt, reflect
 * once per session on the first one (see core/hook.ts).
