/**
 * Where each host keeps the companion skill, as home-relative path parts.
 *
 * ONE map, because two independent code paths write and refresh those directories: the installer
 * copies the packaged skill in and removes it again (src/installer.ts), and every session start
 * re-copies it on drift so `npm update -g` upgrades the skill too (core/skill-sync.ts).
 *
 * They used to hold the paths separately, and the self-update copy listed only four of the ten
 * hosts the installer writes — so Copilot, Grok Build, Cline, dsh, pi and Prime Agent stayed pinned
 * to whichever SKILL.md they happened to be installed with, forever. Same shape as #3524: the
 * sibling nobody wrote a test for is the sibling that gets forgotten, so the list lives once and
 * `installer.test.ts` asserts it over the whole family.
 *
 * A host absent here writes no skills DIRECTORY: opencode and its Kilo fork have no skills
 * mechanism at all, and opencode2 has one but no directory of its own to install into — its plugin
 * registers the packaged skill in memory instead (harness/opencode2.ts, #4352).
