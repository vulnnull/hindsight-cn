/**
 * Keep the STAGED runtime current on its own.
 *
 * `install` copies this package into ~/.hindsight/coding-agents and points every wired agent's
 * hooks at that copy (installer.ts `stageRuntime`). Nothing ever refreshed it: the only update
 * path was the user remembering to re-run `install`, so a machine could sit several versions
 * behind indefinitely — bugs stayed fixed only for people who happened to re-install.
 *
 * Once per `CHECK_INTERVAL_MS`, at session start, this asks the npm registry for the published
 * version and — when it is newer than the staged one — spawns a DETACHED
 * `npx @vectorize-io/hindsight-coding-agents@<version> update`, which re-stages the runtime and
 * touches no host config (see the `update` branch in installer.ts). Fire-and-forget: the current
 * session keeps running the version it already loaded and the next one starts on the new code.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow:
 *   - it runs ONLY from the staged copy. A checkout or an `npx` run is somebody's development or
 *     one-off invocation, and overwriting it with a published build would destroy their work.
 *   - it replaces ONLY a runtime it can prove npx downloaded (`installOrigin` below). A copy staged
 *     from `npm i -g`, from a project dependency, or from a local checkout belongs to whoever
 *     manages that source: updating it behind their back would leave `npm ls -g` reporting a
 *     version that is no longer what runs, or would silently overwrite a developer's built dist.
 *   - it needs `npx` on PATH, since that is how the updater is fetched. Without it there is
 *     nothing to spawn, so it says so once a day rather than failing a spawn each time.
 *   - it stages only. Rewiring hosts unattended would mean choosing which agents to install for,
 *     and that is the user's call (`install` spells it out for exactly this reason).
 *   - `autoUpdate: false` in ~/.hindsight/coding-agent.json (or HINDSIGHT_AUTO_UPDATE=false) turns
 *     it off entirely, for pinned or air-gapped setups.
 *
 * Known window: `stageRuntime` replaces dist/ wholesale, so a hook that happens to spawn during
 * that copy can fail to load its entry point. Already-running processes are unaffected (node has
 * read the bundle by then), the window is milliseconds once a day, and the cost of losing it is
 * one turn without memory — the same outcome as any other hook failure. Serialising against every
 * possible concurrent hook spawn would need a lock every hook takes on every turn, which is a
 * worse trade than the window it closes.
