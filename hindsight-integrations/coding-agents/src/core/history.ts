/**
 * Import a harness's PAST sessions from local disk — the migration path off the older per-agent
 * plugins.
 *
 * Day to day, conversations reach a bank through live write-back, so a fresh install starts from
 * git history alone and knows nothing of what you discussed last month. The old per-agent plugins
 * stored their memory in differently-scoped banks (`claude-code::<project>` vs this package's
 * per-repo `coding-agent::{gitProject}`), and the server's bank import restores a whole bank rather
 * than merging — so those banks cannot be folded together. Re-reading the transcripts the agent
 * already wrote to disk sidesteps that entirely: the same conversations are re-extracted into
 * whichever bank is current.
 *
 * Scoped to ONE repo on purpose. This machine has ~14k Claude sessions; importing all of them would
 * cost extraction on every unrelated project. Each harness below can answer "which sessions belong
 * to this directory" cheaply.
 *
 * Only file-based harnesses are supported. opencode, Kilo, Cursor, Cline, Copilot and Devin keep
 * history in SQLite (`opencode.db`, `store.db`, …) whose schemas are internal and unversioned;
 * reading them would break on any upstream change, so they report as unsupported rather than
 * silently importing nothing.
