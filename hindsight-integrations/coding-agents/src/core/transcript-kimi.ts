/**
 * Kimi Code wire-log reader.
 *
 * Kimi Code has no chat transcript. A session is a DIRECTORY of append-only agent-loop logs — one
 * `wire.jsonl` per agent under
 * `~/.kimi-code/sessions/wd_<workspace>_<hash>/session_<uuid>/agents/<agentId>/wire.jsonl` — and no
 * hook payload names any of them (the CLI's hook feature has no transcript field at all). So this
 * resolves the location from the Stop event's `session_id` the way transcript-grok.ts resolves
 * Grok's, and the reader is handed the SESSION DIRECTORY as its "transcript path".
 *
 * The conversation lives in a TWO-LEVEL envelope, which is what makes this reader unlike every
 * other one here: `content.part`, `tool.call` and `tool.result` are NOT top-level record types —
 * they are nested inside `{"type":"context.append_loop_event","event":{...}}`. A reader that
 * matches those names at the top level matches nothing and retains an empty session.
 *
 * What is kept, normalized to the same `TransportTurn[]` shape as readClaudeTranscript:
 *   - `turn.prompt` whose `origin.kind` is `user` — the human's prompt.
 *   - `content.part` blocks of `part.type:"text"`, joined per STEP into one assistant turn.
 *     `part.type:"think"` is the model's reasoning (70% of all parts in the local corpus) and is
 *     dropped, like Claude `thinking` and Codex `reasoning`.
 *   - `tool.call` → a compact `role:"action"` turn. Its `args` is already an object (unlike dsh's
 *     raw JSON string), so it goes straight to `actionLine`.
 * `tool.result`, `step.begin`/`step.end`, and the ~25 telemetry record types (`llm.request`,
 * `usage.record`, `staleGuard.recorded`, …) are dropped.
 *
 * `origin.kind` is Kimi's exact analogue of dsh's `source.kind` and Claude's `isMeta`: measured
 * over the local corpus, `turn.prompt` arrives with kind `user` (40), `system_trigger` (65, the
 * swarm dispatcher briefing a subagent), `task` (15) and `skill_activation` (2). Only `user` is a
 * human turn; retaining the rest files Kimi's own scaffolding as if the user had said it. A
 * subagent's work is still captured — its assistant/action turns are read normally — and the task
 * it was given survives on the parent side as the `Agent` action turn that spawned it.
 *
 * `context.append_message` is IGNORED ENTIRELY, and that is load-bearing rather than an omission.
 * It is Kimi's context-ASSEMBLY channel, not a record of the agent's work: it carries the host's
 * own injections (`origin.kind:"injection"`, variants todo_list_reminder / permission_mode /
 * date_change / interruption / …), a duplicate mirror of every `turn.prompt`, and — on a FORKED
 * agent — a full replay of the parent's conversation. Measured over 65 local wire logs, all 259
 * assistant `context.append_message` records belonged to the two forked agents of one session and
 * were byte-identical replays of that session's `main` log. Reading the channel therefore
 * double-ingests a forked session and files host scaffolding as user speech; ignoring it needs no
 * `state.json` `forkedFrom` lookup to get right. It is also the anti-feedback filter: a
 * UserPromptSubmit hook's own injection is appended here with `origin.kind:"hook_result"`, so
 * skipping the channel is what stops a retain→recall loop (`stripInjectedMemory` still runs on
 * every kept turn, for a block that leaked into a genuine prompt).
 *
 * Fail-open throughout: a missing directory, an unreadable log, a malformed line, or a line that
 * parses to a non-object JSON value yields no turns rather than throwing.

 * every turn's index, which breaks the append cursor. That reasoning holds here too, so this reader
 * reads each wire log WHOLE and bounds what it KEEPS instead.
 *
 * A cap is still needed, because Kimi is the one harness whose transcript is not a file but a
 * DIRECTORY: one wire.jsonl per agent, and a swarm session on this machine has 61 of them under a
 * single session. Bounding the sum is therefore a cross-file concern that no per-file reader can
